# Uptimer4 #

A bar that sits at the top of your screen and can display over 20 pieces of system information that might be useful to you. System time, system date, uptime, free RAM, free pagefile, free disk space, CPU usage, IP address(es), Winamp controls, battery status, running programs, netstat, etc.

This project is currently suspended until I have more time to update it. Keep sending in bugreports though. :)

Some functions may not work properly with Windows 95 and Windows NT4 without SP6.

*Compatible with: All Windows versions, though some functions will not work on Win95.*
